## Cases

### Case 1
- **Source:** [@ZHO_ZHO_ZHO](https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO/status/1925074523768115281)
- **Prompt:** "A dynamic camera glides through a miniature LEGO world, where an epic adventure unfolds. All sound effects—footsteps, explosions, cars, dragons—are created using mouth sounds by a single AI-generated voice artist.
As each sound is made, the visuals instantly respond: LEGO characters jump into action, cars race, spaceships take off, volcanoes erupt. The journey moves through LEGO-built environments—city streets, underwater ruins, space stations, and lava lairs.
The video is fast-paced, playful, and visually rich, like a blend between The LEGO Movie and next-gen AI storytelling. The sound-to-visual sync creates a magical, toy-driven universe where imagination controls reality."

- **Prompt:** "A high-energy rap battle between Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein on a futuristic sci-fi stage. The camera alternates between close-ups and dramatic wide shots as they diss each other with sharp lyrics. Newton, in a classic 17th-century outfit, raps with a British accent about gravity and apples. Einstein, with wild hair and a German accent, fires back about relativity and space-time. Their lip-sync is perfectly timed to the beat, and their facial expressions are intense and animated. The background pulses with neon lights and holographic equations, reacting to the rhythm. The crowd of AI-generated scientists cheers them on in sync with the music. It feels like a rap battle from another dimension."

### Case 13
- **Source:** [@ZHO_ZHO_ZHO](https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO/status/1925098318776172849)
- **Prompt:**  A humanoid koala in stylish streetwear steps into a neon-lit urban dance stage to battle another breakdancing koala. As the hip-hop track kicks in, the two koalas start a wild dance-off—spinning, locking, popping, and head-spinning in sync with the beat.
The music directly drives their movement, with every bass hit triggering exaggerated, stylized animation. During beat drops, the camera cuts to slow-motion close-ups: fur sways mid-spin, claws strike poses, eyes focused with intensity.
The environment is full of urban flavor: graffiti walls, flashing lights, and a crowd of other animals cheering wildly. It’s hilarious, dynamic, and full of dance battle energy—like Step Up, but with koalas.
