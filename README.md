## About Google Veo

Google Veo is an advanced generative AI model capable of creating high-quality videos from natural language prompts. It supports a variety of styles, camera motions, and scene compositions, making it a powerful tool for both creative and professional use cases. Veo leverages deep learning to interpret detailed prompts and simulate realistic or stylized environments, characters, and actions[^4][^5][^6].

---

## Prompt Philosophy

Crafting effective prompts for Veo involves balancing creativity with clarity. A well-structured prompt typically includes:

- **Subject**: Who or what is the focus?
- **Context**: Where is the scene set?
- **Action**: What is happening?
- **Style**: Realistic, cinematic, cartoon, etc.
- **Camera Motion/Composition**: Wide shot, close-up, panning, etc.
- **Ambiance**: Lighting, mood, color palette.

The prompts in this repo demonstrate a range of genres, moods, and video techniques to showcase Veo’s versatility[^4].

## Example API Usage

Below is a Python example using the Google Gemini API to generate a video with Veo:

```python
import time
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()  # Reads API key from GOOGLE_API_KEY

operation = client.models.generate_videos(
    model="veo-2.0-generate-001",
    prompt="Wide-angle shot of a bustling city skyline at sunrise, golden light reflecting off skyscrapers, with birds flying overhead.",
    config=types.GenerateVideosConfig(
        person_generation="dont_allow",
        aspect_ratio="16:9",
    ),
)

while not operation.done:
    time.sleep(20)
    operation = client.operations.get(operation)

for n, generated_video in enumerate(operation.response.generated_videos):
    client.files.download(file=generated_video.video)
    generated_video.video.save(f"video{n}.mp4")
```
